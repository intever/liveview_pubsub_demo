# LiveviewPubsubDemo

This application demonstrates an approach to using `Ecto.Multi` and `Phoenix.PubSub` to update a Phoenix Liveview in realtime. The steps are documented in this Intever Co [blog article](https://intever.co/blog/ecto-liveview-pubsub).

## Getting Started

To start your Phoenix server:

  * Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
  * Create and migrate your database with `mix ecto.setup`
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server` or inside IEx with `iex -S mix phx.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.
